Around a year ago, when the analysts downgraded the stock, concerns arose due to the uneven trends experienced in the first half of 2022. The worry was that the impact of the pandemic on certain key categories, such as vitamins and cat litter, which had seen a surge in demand due to temporary shifts in consumer behavior, would continue to affect the company's results. This was expected to result in volatility in the company's quarterly performance. </p>\n<p>Additionally, there were reservations about the company's diversification strategy through acquisitions, particularly in areas like acne pads and facial hair removal products.</p>\n",
